# This is LOOPY project.
 Everyone is welcome to use and feel free to contribute this small project to improve.


# Purpose,
This project is for HTML coders to write their codes much faster. If there are multiple lines with most likely the same contents, but with a some small numerical kind of changes(such as increment or decrement a number), then they can use this program to generate full code with less lines of codes.


Here's how this works,
# Eg,
 \<img src="/img1" alt="image1"\><br>
 \<img src="/img2" alt="image2"\><br>
 \<img src="/img3" alt="image3"\><br>
 \<img src="/img4" alt="image4"\><br>
 \<img src="/img5" alt="image5"\><br>

with this program,HTML coders only need to type 1 single line (as follows) for the above example and it automatically generate all lines in a blink of an eye.

 \<img src="/img[LoopY]" alt="[LoopY]">
 

# Things to know,

[LoopY] is a Default KEYWORD(you can change it later if you need to) for identify what text you need to be replaced as a number in loop.

Also you can adjest how many lines you need to loop (by typing the number range for a "[LoopY]" variable.) And you may can customize how it should behave(increment or decrement)

Then program will automatically generate all rest of the lines accordingly your needs. 

# For who,
This program may can be useful for anyone not only for HTML but also other day-to-day text manipulations as well. all you just need to do is type any line and set a range. 


# What I need,

I want to make this exe file as much as simple and fast as well as less dependency with additional files. 

So I didn't use additional ClassLibrary files because it creates a reference with additional .DLL files

If you have any better ideas I'm really happy to hear them and it will be a great help for the future upgrades.



# Enjoy and Happy coding. :)
