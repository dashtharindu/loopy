#This is LOOPY project.
#Everyone is welcome to use and feel free to contribute this small project to improve.
#.
#.
#Purpose,
#using this project HTML coders can write their codes much faster when there are multiple lines with the same contents but with a some small numerical changes(such as increment or decrement a number)
#.
#===========================================================
#.
#Eg,
#<img src="/img1" alt="image1">
#<img src="/img2" alt="image2">
#<img src="/img3" alt="image3">
#<img src="/img4" alt="image4">
#<img src="/img5" alt="image5">
#.
#with this program coders only need to type 1 single line (as follows) for the above example and it automatically generate all lines in a blink of an eye.
#.
#<img src="/img[LoopY]" alt="[LoopY]">
#.
#===========================================================
#.
#[LoopY] is a Default KEYWORD(you can change it later if you need to) for identify what text you need to be replaced as a number in loop.

#and you can adjest how many lines you need to loop by typing the number range for a "[LoopY]" variable. And also you can customize how it should behave(increment or decrement)

#then program will automatically generate all rest of the lines accordingly your input. 


#This program may can be useful for anyone not only for HTML but also other day-to-day text manipulations as well. all you just need to do is type any line and set a range. 

#===========================================================

#I wanted to make this exe file as much as simple and fast as well as less dependency with additional files. 

#So I didn't use additional ClassLibrary files because it creates a reference with additional .DLL files

#If you have any better ideas I'm really happy to hear them and it will be a great help as well.



#:) Enjoy and Happy coding. :)
